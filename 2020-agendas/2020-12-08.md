# agenda 
- pricing & infrastructure that doesn't require removing lower / non-prod envs (John Ritchey
- terraform blue print update on food oasis
- incubator environment
- toggle-able bastion host (Matt Webster from slack)

## incubator environment
what is it: shared infrastructure for projects to develop on, keep costs down

what are the requirements to be added? 
- app should be containerized - e.g a docker image can built, pushed, pulled to deploy the app

how does a new project get added?
who "owns" this infra? 


## Alex VRMS research into costs
5 environments
problem: free-tier resources didn't have enough memory to run the VRMS nodejs app

solutions:
- containers on ecs cluster can add as many as needed
- if an app needs RAM you still have to pay for it

# alternates to AWS
- Digitial Ocean & Linode $5/ month. Cheap!
downside of this is that it atomizes billing & "ownership" of the resources
e.g. if project lead opens a DO droplet and then leaves, that app is then "gone".
running on shared HFLA aws organization allows unified billing, and easier fundraising. 

# solutions for preventing runaway bill
- aws billing alarms
- terraform - infra as code allows :eyes: on resources going in and can be reviewed
- visibility to project leads (read only privileges)
- auto shutoff if project exceeds it's allotted spend
- require new projects to do a write up describing their needs before deploying


# shared dev environment
could we save $$ if we had all apps / projects non-prod environment that was shared? 
yes, but there are downsides!
- how do we test infrastructure changes without?
- it removes the ability to have mirror environment from production (lowers confidence when we make change that it will break something)
- runs the risk 
solutions:
- we could roll out temporary production mirror (staging/uat/qa) environemtn that matches in software AND infrastructure
this would give us good confidence that the app will work as we expect in production
