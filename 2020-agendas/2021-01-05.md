- AGPL default license
- ballotnav monitoring

## AGPL
[source and license text details](https://opensource.org/licenses/AGPL-3.0)
update to the GPLv3
ensures that forks and changes to the source must remain open source and licensed as such. 

### pros
good default, open source friendly

### cons
limits slighty adoption; complicates use by companies

## Fola transition 
@darrenp updates
- limit the work for Dec until ballotnav is spun down
- infra config code will live in food oasis repo

Darren raised concern of where parts of the infra code live. 

## open discussion: incubator
hosting multiple projects in a shared resources will be cheaper!

rules for getting into incubator and out of it to production
@bonnie:
"incubator: prod when you dont have a live site, and its shared by all the other project being incubator 
Individual dev and prod for live sites that are serving customers"

@jared on a shared resources who owns or fixes it when infra goes down? 
@darren more people will be able to be on hand to help out; we'll need scripts, automation to ensure minimal risk of accidental damage to other apps, documentation to make sure knowledge is shared.
