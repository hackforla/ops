# ballotnav costing
Full discussion on ballotnav costing, and options for reducing spend and their tradeoffs. 

Some items we want to keep:
- at least 2 separate environments (prod & non-prod)
- app is available when devs need it

Some items we can give up:
- scalability
- 24/7 uptime

We want to avoid suprise bills
We should have an understanding roughly of the costs per user that. 

## :zap: action items :zap:
some takeaways from this call for ballotnav

- @jafow to do load testing on ballotnav API
